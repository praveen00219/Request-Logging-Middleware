# Request Logging Middleware in Node.js with Express

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates how to implement a request logging middleware in a Node.js application using the Express framework. The middleware captures key details about incoming HTTP requests, such as:

- Request method
- Request URL
- IP address of the client
- Timestamp of the request

Additionally, advanced logging is implemented using the Morgan logging library.
